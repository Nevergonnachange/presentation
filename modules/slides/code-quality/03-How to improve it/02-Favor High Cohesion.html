<h2>Favor High Cohesion</h2>

<blockquote>
    Cohesion in software engineering is the degree to which the elements of a certain module belong together
</blockquote>


<ul>
    <li>Minimize frequency of change</li>
    <li>high cohesion == low cyclomatic complexity</li>
    <li>Code is narrow, focused and does only one thing!</li>
</ul>
