<h2>Avoid Primitive Obsession</h2>

<blockquote>
    Use of primitives instead of small objects for simple tasks (such as currency, ranges, special strings for phone numbers, etc.)

<ul>
    <li>just a field for storing some data...</li>
    <li>Code becomes more flexible</li>
    <li>Easier finding of duplicate code</li>
</ul>
