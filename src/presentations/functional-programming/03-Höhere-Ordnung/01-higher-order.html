<h2>Funktionen h√∂herer Ordnung</h2>

<blockquote style="font-size: 30px;">
    Higher order functions can help you to step up your JavaScript game by making your code more declarative. That is, short, simple, and readable.
    Knowing when and how to use these functions is essential. They make your code easier to understand and maintain. It also makes it easy to combine functions with each other. </blockquote>
